# READ ME
This branch focuses on minimal modifications required to make the MCH pipeline runnable end-to-end.
It resolves conflicts, fixes broken paths/imports, adds missing resources, and introduces a lightweight feature-selection mode for constrained environments.

## Branch info
The full workflow was running on databricks, don't commit any changes on this branch (or other branch) since all modify should be done on databricks and be automaticly updated to github.
To change work directory, go src/mch/config/setting.py

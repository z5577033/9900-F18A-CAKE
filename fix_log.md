fix:

1. confilct requiremts
2. add dockerfile
3. add /app/src/mch/config/base_config.yaml
4. add /app/data/colorProfiles.json
5. fix: if log directory is not exist, create one
6. in setting.py:
    from diseaseTree import ...  -> from disease_tree import ...
    *_dir now point to /app/data or /app/src/mch/, with correct csv filename
7. in training.py:
    read_csv using polar, data type is polar.dataFrame, but prepare_node_data treat them as panda.dataFrame
    colum name should be "biosample_id" instead of "sample_id"

current issue:
1. id in .csv file can't find in diseasetree generated by .joblib (see models/modelTraining.ipynb) 


2025.10.19 fix:

1. create fake dataset using /testTools/fakeDatagenerate.py: replace id in .csv by id in diseaseTree  

2. Reduced the size of data and models since run out of memory:
    RF parameter: n_estimators=50, max_depth=10
    Model parameter: n-jobs = 1, cv-n-jobs = 1
    Replace Differential Methylation (DM) with variance-based top-K feature selection.
    only consider 3000 features, and keep top 50 high-relative features.  

3. new training function entrance: /models/run_training.py  

4. new logfile: /data/logs/training.log
